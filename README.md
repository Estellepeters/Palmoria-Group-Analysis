# Palmoria-Group-Analysis
Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company in Nigeria, is under public scrutiny for gender inequality across its three operational regions. Following negative media coverage, the company seeks to address issues such as gender pay gaps and workforce imbalance.
# Case Study 3: Palmora Group HR Analysis
# 1. Project Overview
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues
bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently
published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This
doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the
business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards,
revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues.
The CEO of Palmoria, Mr Ayodeji Chukwuma, is keen to address these issues before they
get out of hand. The CHRO, Mr Yunus Shofoluwe, has been assigned the task to identify
key areas within the business that could give rise to issues and address them immediately.
Mr Shofoluwe decided to recruit you as an HR Analytics expert to analyse the company’s
HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention. “Now, the
future of gender equality in Palmoria lies in your hands” – the exact words of Mr
Shofoluwe before he handed the data to you.
# 2.CASE SCENARIO
● Analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management
team would need to address
● Your analysis should be visualised using appropriate charts
● Your focus should be on gender-related issues within the organization and its
regions
● The insights required are based on your discretion. However, Mr Gamma, as an
insider, has offered to give you pointers on areas you need to pay attention to
# 3. Required:
● Generally, there are two genders in the organization. However, some employees
refused to disclose their gender. You would need to assign a generic gender status
to these employees
● Some employees are without a salary because they are no longer with the company.
You will need to take those employees out
● Lastly, some departments are indicated as “NULL”. These departments would also
need to be taken out.
